# Tamandua CLI Reference

## Workflow commands

Use these when managing workflow runs (outside individual step execution):

```bash
tamandua workflow list [--json]
tamandua workflow install <workflow-id|--all>
tamandua workflow uninstall <workflow-id|--all> [--force]
tamandua workflow run <workflow-id> "<task>" [--working-directory-for-harness <dir>] [--worktree-origin-repository <dir>] [--worktree-origin-ref <ref>] [--pi-as-harness | --hermes-as-harness] [--no-hurry-please-save-tokens-mode] [--no-relaunch-upon-rugpull]
tamandua workflow status <query>
tamandua workflow runs
tamandua workflow pause <run-id>
tamandua workflow pause-all [--drain]
tamandua workflow resume <run-id>
tamandua workflow resume-all
tamandua workflow stop <run-id>
tamandua workflow autoresearch <run-id>
tamandua nudge
```

`tamandua nudge` wakes all scheduled agents for all currently running runs, causing them to poll once immediately without waiting for their normal timers. Does not resume paused runs or interrupt in-flight agents.

`resume` works for both paused runs (restarted via the daemon) and failed runs (resumed directly). `pause-all --drain` lets in-progress steps finish before pausing.

`install` fetches workflow files, provisions agent workspaces, and registers agents in `~/.tamandua/agents.json`. Use `--all` (or `all`) to install every bundled workflow in one command. `uninstall` removes the workflow and its agent configuration. Use `--force` to skip the active-runs safety check. `uninstall --all` removes every installed workflow.

Use `tamandua update [--force]` only for local Tamandua maintenance. Without `--force`, update blocks after rebuilding if active runs are present -- it leaves services and installed workflows unchanged. Use `--force` to proceed despite active runs (services are stopped and restarted, workflows reinstalled). Remote MCP clients can discover the same maintenance command via `tamandua.update.command`; run the actual update through the local CLI because it may restart dashboard, MCP, and the control plane.

### Harness working directory guidance

- CLI run: `--working-directory-for-harness` is optional; if omitted it defaults to the shell's current working directory.
- Prefer passing an explicit absolute path when the task depends on a specific repo checkout.

### Worktree guidance

- Use `--worktree-origin-repository <dir>` to clone a repo into an isolated git worktree for the run. Defaults to the current repository.
- Use `--worktree-origin-ref <ref>` to check out a specific branch, tag, or SHA in the worktree. Defaults to the current branch.
- Worktree runs never modify the origin repository -- all changes stay in the isolated worktree.

Use `--no-hurry-please-save-tokens-mode` to lower agent polling frequency for the run. When enabled, the scheduler floor becomes 15 minutes (default 15 minutes) instead of the normal 1 minute (default 5 minutes), reducing token consumption. Use this for low-priority or long-running background runs where responsiveness is less important than cost savings.

Use `--no-relaunch-upon-rugpull` to disable automatic replacement-run creation after a rugpull (base branch move) is detected on a failed merge or merge-worktree run. By default, Tamandua creates a replacement run when a rugpull is detected, so the merge can target the updated base.

`tamandua workflow autoresearch <run-id>` shows AutoResearch progress for a workflow run. It resolves the run's harness working directory, reads the project-local `autoresearch.config.json` and `autoresearch.jsonl` files, and prints the current metric summary and recent experiment timeline.

## MCP run start (remote)

When using MCP, `tamandua.run.start` requires a harness working directory. `workingDirectoryForHarness` is mandatory (not optional) for MCP runs.

Required MCP args:
- `workflowId`
- `taskTitle`
- `workingDirectoryForHarness` (mandatory)

Optional MCP args:
- `noHurrySaveTokensMode` (boolean) -- lowers agent polling frequency to save tokens, same as the CLI `--no-hurry-please-save-tokens-mode` flag. When `true`, the scheduler uses a 15-minute floor and 15-minute default instead of the normal 1-minute floor and 5-minute default.

Recovery pattern for tool-calling models:
- If MCP returns: `Argument "workingDirectoryForHarness" must be a non-empty string`
- Retry the same tool call with an explicit absolute path (for example `/home/user/repo`).

## Logs and logs-tail

Use logs to inspect recent run activity or follow events as they happen.

The selector can be:
- A number -- shows that many most recent entries globally
- A run ID prefix -- shows entries for that run
- `#<run-number>` -- shows entries for the Nth run

```bash
# Show recent entries
tamandua logs                        # default: last 20 entries
tamandua logs 50                     # last 50 entries
tamandua logs <run-id>               # entries for a specific run
tamandua logs #3                     # entries for run number 3

# Follow activity as new events arrive
tamandua logs-tail                   # tail recent activity (live)
tamandua logs-tail 50                # tail, starting with last 50 entries
tamandua logs-tail <run-id>          # tail events for a specific run
tamandua logs-tail #3                # tail events for run number 3
```

Example: after starting a workflow, follow its progress:

```bash
tamandua workflow run feature-dev "Add login page"
# -> Run started: 8a3b2c1d-...
tamandua logs-tail 8a3b2c1d          # follow events as they arrive
```

## Dashboard lifecycle and source path

Start, stop, and check the web dashboard:

```bash
tamandua dashboard start [--port N]    # Start dashboard (default: 3334)
tamandua dashboard stop                # Stop dashboard
tamandua dashboard status              # Check dashboard + MCP status
```

`dashboard status` reports both dashboard and MCP server status in a single output. The remote MCP server can be managed independently with `tamandua mcp start [--port N]`, `tamandua mcp stop`, and `tamandua mcp status` (standalone on port 3338 by default).

`tamandua source-path` prints the source checkout path that `tamandua update` uses to pull, rebuild, and reinstall.

## First-time setup with get-ready

Use `tamandua get-ready` to prepare a fresh Tamandua checkout.

```bash
tamandua get-ready
```

`get-ready` performs these setup steps in order:
1. Installs all bundled workflows into your Tamandua state directory
2. Ensures the CLI launcher symlink exists at `~/.local/bin/tamandua`
3. Starts the dashboard daemon if it is not already running (the daemon co-manages the dashboard HTTP server and the in-process control plane)
4. Reports dashboard and MCP server status

Run `get-ready` after pulling a new Tamandua checkout or after `tamandua update` if workflows or services need reinstallation. It is safe to run multiple times -- already-installed workflows are skipped and a running daemon is left untouched.

## Hermes harness support (Alpha)

The `--hermes-as-harness` flag runs agents with the Hermes harness instead of the default pi harness.

```bash
tamandua workflow run <workflow-id> "<task>" --hermes-as-harness
```

Hermes support is in alpha. It is very slow compared to pi, and token accounting is broken -- token counts reported by Hermes runs are inaccurate. Pi is the default and recommended harness for production use.

The `--pi-as-harness` flag explicitly selects the pi harness (this is the default, so the flag is rarely needed unless a previous run used `--hermes-as-harness`).

These flags are mutually exclusive -- you cannot specify both in the same run.

To use a custom Hermes binary, set the `TAMANDUA_HERMES_BINARY` environment variable:

```bash
export TAMANDUA_HERMES_BINARY=/path/to/hermes
tamandua workflow run <workflow-id> "<task>" --hermes-as-harness
```

If `TAMANDUA_HERMES_BINARY` is not set, Tamandua searches for `hermes` on `PATH`. The binary is validated at scheduling time -- if it is not found or not executable, the run fails at startup.

## System status

Use `tamandua status` for a comprehensive overview of the Tamandua system:

```bash
tamandua status
```

`status` reports:
- **Services** -- Dashboard, MCP, and control-plane status (up/down, PID, port)
- **Tamandua Info** -- Source path, skill path, version, and source tree SHA256
- **Workflow Runs** -- Summary of all runs (running, paused, done, failed)
- **Running Processes** -- Active pi/hermes harness processes spawned by Tamandua

## Worktree management

Worktree commands manage the git worktrees Tamandua creates for isolated workflow runs.

```bash
tamandua worktree list
tamandua worktree status <run-id>
tamandua worktree remove <run-id> [--force]
tamandua worktree prune --completed --older-than <duration>
```

`list` shows all managed worktrees with run ID, status, cleanup policy, and filesystem path.

`status` shows detailed worktree info for a run: origin repo, ref, SHA, original branch, worktree path, and cleanup policy.

`remove` deletes a worktree and its tracking entry. By default, only non-ready worktrees can be removed. Use `--force` to remove any status.

`prune` cleans up old worktrees for completed or canceled runs older than a duration (e.g. `7d`, `24h`, `30m`). Requires both `--completed` and `--older-than` flags.

## Control plane management

The control plane provides run-scoped scheduling that the dashboard daemon uses to manage agent polling and work dispatch.

```bash
tamandua control-plane start [--port N]
tamandua control-plane stop
tamandua control-plane status
```

Default port: 3339.

`status` reports whether the control plane is running (PID, port, endpoint).

Start will refuse if the control plane is already running, printing its current status instead. Stop is safe to run even when no control plane is active.

## Full uninstall

`tamandua uninstall [--force]` stops all Tamandua services and removes every installed workflow, including agent workspaces, agent registrations, and cron jobs.

```bash
tamandua uninstall [--force]
```

By default, uninstall checks for active runs (running or paused) and refuses if any exist. Use `--force` to skip this check.

Compare with `tamandua workflow uninstall <name> [--force]` which removes a single workflow without stopping services, and `tamandua workflow uninstall --all [--force]` which removes all workflows (also no service stops).

## Step stories (diagnostics)

```bash
tamandua step stories <run-id>
```

Use `step stories` to inspect current story status for a run when diagnosing blocked pipelines.

## Review artifacts on changes

When making code changes to Tamandua itself, review whether these artifacts need updating:
- `docs/creating-workflows.md` -- user-facing workflow documentation
- `src/server/mcp-server.ts` -- MCP tools registered for agent use
- `src/cli/cli.ts` -- CLI commands that agents invoke
- `src/server/index.html` -- dashboard UI
- `README.md` -- project overview

Changes that typically cascade to multiple artifacts:
- **Step lifecycle** changes -> update CLI, MCP, docs
- **CLI command** additions or changes -> update skill, MCP, docs
- **Agent provisioning** changes -> update skill, workspace files
- **Output format contract** changes -> update docs, MCP

If you update the skill file, verify that bundled workflow persona AGENTS.md files reflect the change.

## Polling loop example

```bash
# Phase 1: Peek
tamandua step peek feature-dev_developer --run-id 7aeb4da9-1111-4222-8333-abcdefabcdef
# -> NO_WORK (stop) OR HAS_WORK (continue)

# Phase 2: Claim
tamandua step claim feature-dev_developer --run-id 7aeb4da9-1111-4222-8333-abcdefabcdef
# -> {"stepId":"87409f73-...","runId":"7aeb4da9-...","input":"Implement ..."}
# Save stepId=87409f73-...

# Execute the input task...

# Success report (uses saved stepId)
echo 'STATUS: done
CHANGES: Added skill docs and tests
TESTS: node --test tests/*.test.ts' | tamandua step complete 87409f73-4ba6-492a-be44-30b2b6ffbadb

# Failure alternative
# tamandua step fail 87409f73-4ba6-492a-be44-30b2b6ffbadb "Missing repository path"
```
